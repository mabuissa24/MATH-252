                "Write a function $\\texttt{dh(g,p,B)}$ that performs Alice's role in Diffie-Hellman key exchange, using a randomly chosen secret number $a$. More precisely: you are given a prime number $p$, an element $g \\in \\mathbb{Z} / p \\mathbb{Z}$, and Bob's transmission $B$. Your function should return a pair of two numbers $A,S$, where $A$ is the number you transmit to Bob, and $S$ is the shared secret. You should look up how to generate random numbers in Python (don't worry about finding a \"cryptographically secure\" random number generator, just use the standard one in Python). The prime $p$ will be between $16$ and $256$ bits long, and the autograder will run your code several times on each input to make sure that it appears to be choosing the secret number $a$ randomly.\n"
